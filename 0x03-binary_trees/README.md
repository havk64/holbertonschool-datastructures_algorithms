### 24. Is BST

The [110-binary_tree_is_bst.c](110-binary_tree_is_bst.c) file has a function that
checks if a binary tree is a valid [Binary Search Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_tree)

- Prototype: `int binary_tree_is_bst(const binary_tree_t *tree);`
- Where `tree` is a pointer to the root node of the tree to check
- It returns 1 if tree is a valid `BST`, and 0 otherwise
- If tree is NULL, it returns 0

Properties of a Binary Search Tree:

- The left subtree of a node contains only nodes with values less than the nodeâ€™s value
- The right subtree of a node contains only nodes with values greater than the nodeâ€™s value
- The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree
- There's no duplicate values

        $ make

		$ ./110-is_bst
               .-------(098)--.
          .--(012)--.       (128)--.
        (010)     (054)          (402)
        Is 98 bst: 1
        Is 12 bst: 1

        (010)     (054)     (097)     (402)
        Is 98 bst: 0

### 25. BST - Insert 

The [111-bst_insert.c](111-bst_insert.c) file has a function that
inserts a value in a Binary Search Tree

- Prototype: bst_t *bst_insert(bst_t **tree, int value);
- Where `tree` is a double pointer to the root node of the BST to insert the value
in and `value` is the value to store in the node to be inserted
- It returns a pointer to the created node, or NULL on failure
- If the address stored in tree is NULL, the created node becomes the root node.
- If the value is already present in the tree, it is ignored

        $ make

		$ ./111-bst_insert
        Inserted: 98
        Inserted: 402
        Inserted: 12

        Inserted: 512
        Inserted: 1
        Node should be nil -> (nil)

                                 (256)

### 26. BST - Array to BST 

The [112-array_to_bst.c](112-array_to_bst.c) file has a function that
builds a Binary Search Tree from an array

- Prototype: bst_t *array_to_bst(int *array, size_t size);
- Where `array` is a pointer to the first element of the array to be converted and
`size` is the number of element in the array
- it returns a pointer to the root node of the created BST, or NULL on failure
- If a value of the array is already present in the tree, this value is ignored

        $ make

		$ ./112-bst_array
                                             .------------(079)-------.

### 27. BST - Search 

The [113-bst_search.c](113-bst_search.c) file has a function that
removes a node from a Binary Search Tree

- Prototype: bst_t *bst_search(const bst_t *tree, int value);
- Where `tree` is a pointer to the root node of the BST to search
and `value` is the value to look for
- It returns a pointer to the node containing a value equals to `value`
- If `tree` is NULL or if nothing is found, it returns NULL

        $ make

		$ ./113-bst_search 
                                             .------------(079)-------.

          .--(032)--.
        (022)     (034)
        Node should be nil -> (nil)

### 28. BST - Remove

The [114-bst_remove.c](114-bst_remove.c) file has a function that
removes a node from a Binary Search Tree

- Prototype: `bst_t *bst_remove(bst_t *root, int value);`
- Where `root` is a pointer to the root node of the tree to remove a node of
and `value` is the value to look for
- Once located, the node containing a value equals to value is removed and freed
- If the node to be deleted has two children, it is replaced with its first
in-order successor (not predecessor)
- It returns a pointer to the new root node of the tree after removing the
desired value

### 29. Big O #BST 

The [115-O](115-O) file has the answer to the question:

> What are the average time complexities of those operations on a Binary Search Tree (one answer per line):

- Inserting the value n
- Removing the node with the value n
- Searching for a node in a BST of size n

### 30. AVL

The [120-binary_tree_is_avl.c](120-binary_tree_is_avl.c) file has a function that
checks if a binary tree is a valid [AVL Tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AVL_tree)

- Prototype: `int binary_tree_is_avl(const binary_tree_t *tree);`
- Where `tree` is a pointer to the root node of the tree to check
- It returns 1 if tree is a valid `AVL Tree`, and 0 otherwise
- If tree is NULL, it returns 0

Properties of an `AVL Tree`:

- An `AVL Tree` is a `BST`
- The difference between heights of left and right subtrees cannot be more than one
- The left and right subtree each must also be a binary search tree
